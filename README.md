# Ultralight Java Reborn

###### Complete rewrite of the original Java wrapper for the [Ultralight](https://ultralig.ht) web engine

# About

This project is a Java wrapper for the [Ultralight](https://ultralig.ht) web engine which focuses on providing a 
simple, easy-to-use, and lightweight API for embedding web content in Java applications.

## What is Ultralight?

Ultralight is a lightweight, cross-platform, standards-compliant HTML UI engine. It's not a full browser, it's
designed specifically for creating native applications with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Ultralight is written in C++
and meant to be embedded into native applications (on desktop or console platforms). It's a great solution for
projects that want a UI that runs off of HTML but doesn't want to deal with the complexity of embedding a full
browser like Chromium or WebKit.

## What makes Ultralight Java Reborn different from other solutions?

Other than solutions like JCEF and the JavaFX WebView, Ultralight is meant to be embedded into applications and
games. As such, it focuses on speed and integration with custom code. Ultralight Java Reborn is a wrapper around
the Ultralight C++ API.
